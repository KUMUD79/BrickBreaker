Brick Breaker – 2D Arcade Game Developed in Unity

Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style 2D game developed using Unity and C#, designed to provide an engaging and fast-paced gaming experience for laptop and desktop users. The main objective of the game is for the player to control a paddle positioned at the bottom of the screen and use it to bounce a ball upward to break all the bricks arranged at the top. The challenge lies in preventing the ball from falling off the screen while clearing all bricks to progress through levels.

The game consists of multiple levels, each increasing in difficulty, ball speed, and brick layout complexity. With every stage, the player’s reflexes, accuracy, and timing are tested. The realistic physics and collision mechanics implemented through Unity make the gameplay smooth, responsive, and enjoyable on a laptop setup using keyboard controls.

Brick Breaker includes several power-ups and bonuses that appear randomly during gameplay, such as paddle expansion, multi-ball effects, and extra lives, keeping the experience unpredictable and fun. Players can earn points for every brick they destroy, and their total score and lives are displayed on the screen, allowing for progress tracking and replay value.

The visuals are simple yet vibrant, featuring colorful brick patterns, smooth animations, and light particle effects to enhance the classic arcade look. Background music and sound effects add energy and excitement to the game, keeping the player immersed.

Designed exclusively for laptop users, Brick Breaker supports keyboard-based input controls for easy gameplay. This project showcases key concepts of 2D game design, physics simulation, object-oriented programming, and user interface development using Unity, making it a complete example of beginner-to-intermediate-level game creation.
